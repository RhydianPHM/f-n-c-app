Welcome to my Founders and Coders application page! My name is Rhydian. I used to be a (desktop) applications developer (Java, C++) until around 2011 and then decided to go into low-tech sales to round off my people skills!
				I never had any experience in front end design, especially web development/languages and I've realised I need those skills to prototype ideas I now have for potential web products! Fortunately, 
				I went to one of the Founders and Coders workshops where I discovered that there is a course commencing in February and applications are open until 30th November, leaving me around 10 days to complete the prerequisites! 
				<br><br>
				Since then I have been rushing to complete the application for the next course date because the next 6 months is my chance to study full-time and I'm especially keen to get to know other students while working on projects together! 
				<br><br>
				I only just about completed the Code Wars katas to reach level 5 kyu on the night of November 29th and then attempted to write a Javascript kata, which I've tried 4 varieties of, each has been retired (I'm writing them too fast without enough tests!)</p>
